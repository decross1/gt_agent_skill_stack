# D-018 — SM12x kernel-compatibility constraint acknowledged

_apparatus decision_

**Date locked.** May 2026, added on review.
**Decision.** The apparatus does NOT depend on any kernel that requires
SM100 (datacenter Blackwell) features — `tcgen05`, TMEM, 2-SM cooperative
MMA, FlashAttention 4, FlashMLA's SM100 backend. The Spark reports as
SM12x (compute capability 12.1) and is architecturally distinct from
SM100 despite both being "Blackwell."
**Alternatives.**
- Plan around SM100-only kernels and accept they won't work on the Spark.
**Rationale.** The Spark's SM12x is its own ISA in Blackwell. vLLM 0.19+
patched its NVFP4 paths to work on SM12x; not all libraries have. If a
future optimization proposal cites "FlashAttention 4 makes this 2x
faster," that proposal is non-portable to the Spark and needs reframing.
**Reversibility.** Not applicable — this is a hardware constraint, not
a chosen direction.
