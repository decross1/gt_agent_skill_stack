# D-006 — Qwen 3.6 deferred to Week 2–3

_apparatus decision_

**Date locked.** Validation-pass review, May 2026.
**Decision.** Use Gemma 4 26B-A4B MoE alone for Week 1. Introduce Qwen 3.6
27B Dense as a manually-swappable alternative starting Week 2 or 3.
**Alternatives.**
- Use both models from Day 1 with a routing layer.
- Use Qwen 3.6 as primary from Day 1.
**Rationale.** A configuration matrix with two models from Day 1 would
mask Week 1 bugs — when a problem appears, you'd have to disambiguate
"model A behavior" vs. "model B behavior" vs. "harness issue" vs. "vLLM
issue." Single-model in Week 1 gives clean signal. Qwen 3.6 only matters
if Gemma 4's coding quality proves insufficient for autoresearch
modifications, and that hypothesis can't be tested without Week 1's
foundations in place anyway.
**Reversibility.** Trivial. Adding Qwen 3.6 is one model download and one
config change.
