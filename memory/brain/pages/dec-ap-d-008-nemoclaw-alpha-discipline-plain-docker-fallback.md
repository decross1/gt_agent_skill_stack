# D-008 — NemoClaw alpha discipline, plain-Docker fallback

_apparatus decision_

**Date locked.** Validation-pass review, May 2026; reinforced by ongoing
NemoClaw README operational guidance.
**Decision.** Use NemoClaw as the intended sandbox runtime; cap NemoClaw
onboarding at 90 minutes on Day 1; if onboarding fails, fall back to
security-hardened plain Docker (`seccomp`, `no-new-privileges`,
`cap-drop=ALL`). Re-attempt NemoClaw with fresh eyes at the end of Week
1, not during Week 1.
**Alternatives.**
- Block on NemoClaw onboarding until it works.
- Skip NemoClaw entirely, use plain Docker from the start.
**Rationale.** NemoClaw was announced at GTC 2026 March 16 and is
explicitly "not production-ready" per NVIDIA's own docs. Multiple
operational footguns are documented: direct `openshell self-update`,
`npm update -g openshell`, and `openshell sandbox create` break
NemoClaw's state management and require `nemoclaw onboard` to recover.
For Week 1's threat model (researcher's own code on the researcher's own
box), plain Docker with the hardening above is good enough. NemoClaw's
value proposition is *better* isolation for *agentic* workloads where
worker code might do unexpected things — a Phase 2+ concern when
autoresearch loops run overnight, not Week 1 when every worker is
summarize_paper or play_one_round.
**Reversibility.** Easy by design. Day 6's orchestrator router reads
`state.fallbacks_taken.day1_nemoclaw` and branches accordingly; bringing
NemoClaw up later just flips the router.
