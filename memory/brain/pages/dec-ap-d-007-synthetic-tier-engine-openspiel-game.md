# D-007 — Synthetic-tier engine: OpenSpiel + Game Reasoning Arena

_apparatus decision_

**Date locked.** Validation-pass review, May 2026.
**Decision.** Use `github.com/SLAMPAI/game_reasoning_arena` (GRA) on top
of OpenSpiel as the synthetic-tier game environment. Day 7's repeated PD
experiment runs on this stack.
**Alternatives.**
- Custom synthetic-tier game engine.
- PettingZoo / Gymnasium.
- Direct OpenSpiel with custom LLM-agent glue.
**Rationale.** GRA already supports a local vLLM backend, has `prisoners_dilemma` and `matching_pennies` built in, and integrates an
agent registry that matches the apparatus's "TFT, grim trigger, all-C,
all-D, mirror-LLM" Day-7 needs. Building a custom engine would consume
1–2 weeks for no research-content gain. The validation pass estimated
the savings at exactly that range.
**Reversibility.** Medium. Switching engines mid-Phase-1 would require
re-implementing the agent strategies; not blocking but not free.
