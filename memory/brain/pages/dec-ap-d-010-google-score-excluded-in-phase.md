# D-010 — Google SCORE excluded in Phase 1

_apparatus decision_

**Date locked.** Technical plan v1, April 30, 2026.
**Decision.** Use the bandit keep/discard ratchet planned in Research
Program v2 for autoresearch. Do NOT introduce Google's SCORE UCB-based
tree search in Phase 1.
**Alternatives.**
- Replace bandit with SCORE-style UCB tree search now.
- Use both, route between them.
**Rationale.** (a) The research program already planned a bandit
keep/discard criterion, which is in the same algorithmic family. (b)
SCORE's advantage emerges at thousands of candidates, which the Spark
can't sustain for training-based experiments. (c) For game-simulation
experiments (which evaluate in seconds), the simpler bandit with good
heuristics gets most of the value.
**Reversibility.** Easy. Noted as a Phase 2 upgrade if the greedy
approach proves limiting for mechanism-design search.
